# GitHub Dark
A Discord theme styled like GitHub's dark theme.
*(Original Theme: https://github.com/moistp1ckle/GitHub_Dark)*
### Requirements
Any Discord modification that supports any kind of theming, so either Vencord or BetterDiscord.

#### anyways..

this is also pretty pretty lazy "update" of the old unupdated theme lol, I might clean it up in the future, but all I cared about was it just looking good again
